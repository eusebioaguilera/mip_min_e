# mip_min_e
This repo contains the implementation of the paper "Novel method to obtain the optimal polygonal approximation of digital planar curves based on Mixed Integer Programming"

This implementation may contain errors so feel free to report any bug you find at the issues section. The code can use two different LP/MIP solvers GLPK and GUROBI. Notice that GLPK [2] is open source and you can use it for free. In the other hand GUROBI [3] is a commercial LP/MIP solver and you need a license in order to use it. Please refer to the original web sites to download a copy of the software packages in order to use this implementation of the paper.

Please if you find useful this code cite the original paper by using the information contained in the file "cite.bib" in this repository.
